# Comparison of SSG using various JS and Rust frameworks

This is a comparison of various static site generators (SSG) using different frameworks. The goal is to compare what's possible in each framework.

Currently, the following frameworks are included:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) in `next-example`
- [Leptos](https://book.leptos.dev) in `leptos-example`
- [WIP] [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/) in `dioxus-example`
- [WIP] [Perseus](https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs/0.4.x/intro) in `perseus-example`
